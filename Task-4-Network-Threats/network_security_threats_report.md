Task 4 - Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

* Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks -
    A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to make a machine or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic.

How It Works -
    Attackers flood a target server with massive amounts of requests, exhausting system resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing services.

Real Example -
    GitHub DDoS Attack (2018) GitHub suffered a massive DDoS attack reaching 1.35 Tbps.

Prevention -
  - Deploy Web Application Firewalls
  - Use anti-DDoS services like Cloudflare
  - Implement rate-limiting on servers


* Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks -
    A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties.

How It Works -
    The attacker places themselves between the client and server communication path, capturing sensitive data such as login credentials.

Real Example -
    DigiNotar Hack (2011) Attackers issued fraudulent SSL certificates to intercept secure communications.

Prevention
   - Enforce HTTPS and use SSL/TLS certificates.
   - Avoid using public Wi-Fi without a VPN.
   - Enable end-to-end encryption wherever possible.

* Spoofing Attacks -
     Spoofing occurs when an attacker impersonates a trusted device or user to gain unauthorized access.

Types of Spoofing
    IP Spoofing:** Attacker disguises their IP address.
    Email Spoofing:** Fake emails that appear legitimate.
    ARP Spoofing:** Manipulates network traffic within a LAN.

 Real Example
   - Sony PlayStation Network Hack (2011):** Attackers used spoofed emails to phish employees.

Prevention
   - Use anti-spoofing filters and authentication mechanisms.
   - Enable network monitoring and intrusion detection systems.
   - Educate users to recognize phishing emails.

Conclusion
Understanding these threats and implementing security measures is critical to protecting network infrastructure and sensitive data.
