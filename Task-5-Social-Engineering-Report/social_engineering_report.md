Task 5 - Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks

Objective -
This report explores social engineering attacks including phishing, pretexting, and baiting. It explains how these attacks work, provides real-world examples, and recommends preventive measures.

Phishing Attacks -
Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers send fraudulent messages, often emails, pretending to be from a trusted source to steal sensitive information.

How It Works -
Attackers trick victims into clicking malicious links or providing credentials by mimicking legitimate websites and communications.

Real Example -
Google Docs Phishing Attack (2017) Users received fake Google Doc invites that harvested their credentials.

 Prevention -
- Educate users about phishing indicators.
- Use email filtering and anti-phishing tools.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Pretexting Attacks -
In pretexting, attackers create a fabricated scenario (pretext) to manipulate victims into providing information or performing actions.

How It Works -
The attacker pretends to be a trusted individual (e.g., IT staff) and requests sensitive information under a false pretense.

Real Example -
Apple iCloud Scam: Attackers posing as Apple support contacted users to gain account access.

Prevention
- Verify the identity of callers or requestors before sharing information.
- Train employees on verification protocols.

Baiting Attacks-
Baiting involves luring victims with a promising item (e.g., free software or USB drive) that delivers malware once interacted with.

How It Works-
Victims are enticed to plug in infected devices or download malicious files.

Real Example-
USB Drop Experiment: Studies showed 48% of people plugged in unknown USBs, compromising their systems.

Prevention -
Avoid using unknown storage devices.
Employ endpoint security solutions.

Conclusion-
Social engineering attacks exploit human behavior. Organizations must focus on user education, strict verification procedures, and technical controls to mitigate such risks.
